# IoT Devices Lab - Getting Started with IoT Devices

This repo hosts code used for learning about IoT using ESP32 devices and Micropython. Instructions may be reusable up to some point for similar devices like the ESP8266 or the RP2040, but to achieve best results, get one of the ESP32-based boards that are in the market.

The repo and its instructions rely on a dev environment that is Mac OS X/Linux based. If you're using Windows, I recommend you going to - [IoT Devices Lab Series 1 - Setting up an IoT Development Workstation](https://docs.canadillas.org/iot/IoT_Devices_Lab_Series-1) where I've written specific instructions on getting a Linux Development VM based on Virtualbox using Vagrant up and running.

## Instructions

Clone the repo and follow the instructions hosted at:
